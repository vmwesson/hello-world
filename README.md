Learning how to create a repository.
I am very new to code and I am not that ocmfortable with computers, so this is a little hard for me. I guess I have been spoiled because  Ihave a teenage son that has been my go-to IT guy for a while. But now that he is away at college and will probably soon be moving out, it's time for me to learn this on my own. Plus I need it for my new job that I love.
